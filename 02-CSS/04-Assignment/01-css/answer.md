CSS Flexbox and CSS Grid are two powerful layout models in CSS, each designed for different purposes. Here are the main differences between them and when you might choose one over the other:

1. **Layout Approach**:
   - **Flexbox**: Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout model, meaning it focuses on arranging items in either a row or a column. It is well-suited for creating flexible and dynamic layouts along a single axis.
   - **Grid**: CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout model, allowing you to define both rows and columns simultaneously. It excels at creating grid-based layouts where items can be positioned both horizontally and vertically.

2. **Direction**:
   - **Flexbox**: Primarily used for creating layouts in one direction (either rows or columns). You can nest flex containers to create more complex layouts, but it remains fundamentally one-dimensional.
   - **Grid**: Provides control over both rows and columns, allowing for more complex two-dimensional layouts. You can create grids of varying sizes and easily position items within those grids.

3. **Alignment**:
   - **Flexbox**: It offers excellent control over alignment and distribution along the main axis (either rows or columns).
   - **Grid**: Provides precise control over item placement within rows and columns. You can align items both horizontally and vertically, making it more versatile for complex layouts.

4. **Content Ordering**:
   - **Flexbox**: Easily reorders items within a single row or column without affecting the source order in the HTML.
   - **Grid**: Allows for both row and column-based content ordering, making it more flexible when it comes to rearranging content.

5. **Use Cases**:
   - **Flexbox**: Best suited for elements within a container when you want to distribute space, align items, or create flexible layouts along a single axis. Commonly used in navigation menus, toolbars, and items within a card component.
   - **Grid**: Ideal for creating grid-based layouts, such as web pages with complex, responsive structures. It's great for aligning multiple items both horizontally and vertically and is often used for arranging content in rows and columns.

6. **Complexity**:
   - **Flexbox**: Simpler to learn and use for one-dimensional layouts. It's often a better choice when you don't need the complexity of a two-dimensional grid.
   - **Grid**: Provides more advanced control and versatility for complex layouts, but it can be more challenging to master due to its two-dimensional nature.

7. **Browser Support**:
   - Both Flexbox and Grid are widely supported in modern browsers, but older browser versions may have limited support. Consider the target audience and browser requirements when choosing between them.

In summary, choose CSS Flexbox when you need to create one-dimensional, flexible layouts with items distributed along a single axis. Use CSS Grid for two-dimensional layouts with precise control over rows and columns, especially when dealing with complex web page structures. In practice, you may also use them in combination, with Flexbox for smaller-scale layout within Grid containers for larger-scale page structure.
