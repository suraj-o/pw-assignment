    <h2>What is the DOCTYPE Declaration in HTML?</h2>
    <p>The DOCTYPE declaration in HTML, short for "Document Type Declaration," is a statement at the beginning of an HTML document that specifies the type and version of the HTML being used in the document. It helps the web browser and other user agents understand how to interpret and render the content of the HTML document correctly. The DOCTYPE declaration is not an HTML element but rather an instruction to the browser about which version of HTML</p>
    <h3>Example: &ltDOCTYPE html&gt</h3>
    <p>In this example, indicates that the document is written in HTML5. HTML5 is the latest version of the HTML standard as of my last knowledge update in September 2021.</p>
    <h3>If we want to use older version like html 4.01</h3>
    <h3>&ltDOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">
    </h3>
    <p>Different versions of HTML have had different DOCTYPE declarations, each designed to inform the browser how to render the page</p>
