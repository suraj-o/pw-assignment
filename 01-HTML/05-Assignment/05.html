    <p><strong>Defination:</strong> A favicon, short for "favorite icon," is a small, typically square or rectangular image or icon associated with a website or web page. Favicon images are displayed in various places, such as browser tabs, bookmarks, and the address bar, to provide a visual representation of the website or web page. They serve as a branding element and help users quickly identify and access a particular website among their open tabs or saved bookmarks.</p>
