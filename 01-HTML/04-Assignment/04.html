    <h2>Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Improving the accessibility of HTML documents involves various techniques and practices to ensure that web content is perceivable, operable, and understandable for all users.<br><br> Here are three important ways to enhance the accessibility of HTML:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Semantic HTML Elements:</strong> Semantic HTML elements provide meaning and structure to your web content, making it easier for both humans and assistive technologies to understand. Examples of semantic elements include &ltheader>, &ltnav>, &ltmain>, &ltsection>, &ltarticle>, &ltaside>, and &ltfooter>. Properly using these elements helps define the document's structure and purpose, enhancing accessibility. For instance, &ltnav> should be used for navigation menus, &ltarticle> for self-contained content, and &ltfooter> for the footer of a section or the page.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li><strong>Provide Descriptive Text Alternatives:</strong> Many users with disabilities, such as those who are blind or have low vision, rely on screen readers to access web content. To accommodate these users, include descriptive text alternatives for non-text content, such as images and multimedia. Use the alt attribute for images (&ltimg>), and provide captions, transcripts, or descriptions for audio and video content. These alternatives should convey the same information and context as the visual or auditory content they represent.</li>
        <br><br>
        <li><strong>Use Proper Heading Structure:</strong> A logical and well-organized heading structure is essential for web accessibility. Headings (&lth1>, &lth2>, &lth3>, etc.) create an outline of your content and help users understand its hierarchy. Ensure that you follow a consistent and meaningful heading structure, where &lth1> represents the main topic or page title, followed by &lth2> for subsections, and so on. Avoid skipping heading levels and use headings to provide structure, not just for styling purposes.</li>
        <br><br>
    </ol>
        <p>By following these practices and incorporating other accessibility guidelines and techniques, such as providing keyboard navigation, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and testing your content with assistive technologies, you can significantly improve the accessibility of your HTML documents, making them more inclusive and user-friendly for a diverse audience.</p>
