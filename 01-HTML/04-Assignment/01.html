    <h2>Features of HTML5</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Semantic Elements:</strong> HTML5 introduced semantic elements like &ltheader>, &ltfooter>, &ltnav>, &ltarticle>, &ltsection>, and &ltaside>. These elements help define the structure of a web page more clearly, making it easier for both developers and search engines to understand the content.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Audio and Video Support:</strong> HTML5 introduced native &ltaudio> and &ltvideo> elements, allowing developers to embed multimedia content directly into web pages without the need for third-party plugins like Flash.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Forms:</strong> HTML5 includes new input types (e.g., email, url, date, number) and attributes (e.g., required, placeholder, autocomplete) that enhance the functionality and usability of web forms. Additionally, the &ltdatalist> element allows for creating predefined options for input fields.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Local Storage:</strong> HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally in the user's browser, enabling offline functionality and improved performance.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Accessibility:</strong> HTML5 includes elements and attributes that enhance web accessibility, such as the aria-* attributes for labeling and describing content for assistive technologies.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>New APIs:</strong> HTML5 introduced various APIs, including the History API for manipulating the browser's navigation history, the Drag and Drop API for drag-and-drop interactions, and the Web Storage API for key-value data storage.
        </li><br><br>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Security:</strong> HTML5 includes security enhancements like the Content Security Policy (CSP) and the &ltsandbox> attribute for iframes to mitigate various web security threats.

        <li>
            <strong>WebSockets:</strong> HTML5 includes the WebSocket API, which enables real-time, full-duplex communication between a client and a server, facilitating interactive and dynamic web applications.
