    <h2>HTML Entities:</h2>
    <p>HTML entities are special codes used in HTML to represent characters that have special meanings in HTML or characters that cannot be easily typed using a keyboard. They are particularly useful when you want to display reserved characters, symbols, or characters from non-Latin scripts in your HTML documents. HTML entities are written using an ampersand (&) followed by a code or name and terminated by a semicolon (;).<br> Here are five commonly used HTML entities:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>& LT;(Less Than)</strong> Represents the less than sign (&lt;). It is used to display the character without interpreting it as an HTML tag.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>& GT;(Greater Than)</strong> Represents the less than sign (&gt;). It is used to display the character without interpreting it as an HTML tag. </li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>& NBSP;(Non-Breaking Sapce)</strong> Represents the character which (&nbsp;) is invisible without interpreting it as HTML tag.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>& COPY;(Copyright)</strong> Represents the Copyright symbol (&copy;) without interpreting it as HTML tag.</li>
        <br>
        <li><strong>& REG;(Registered Trademark)</strong> Represents the Registered symbol (&reg;) without interpreting it as HTML tag.</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
