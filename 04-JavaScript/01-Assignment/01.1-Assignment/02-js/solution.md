JavaScript and HTML serve different purposes in web development, and they complement each other to create dynamic and interactive web pages. Here are the key differences between JavaScript and HTML, along with examples of situations where you would use each:

**HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):**

1. **Purpose:** HTML is a markup language used to structure content on the web. It provides the basic building blocks for creating the elements on a webpage, such as headings, paragraphs, images, links, and more.

2. **Example:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>My Web Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
       <p>This is a simple webpage.</p>
       <img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
       <a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example.com</a>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Use Cases:** HTML is used to define the structure and content of a webpage. It is static and doesn't provide interactivity on its own. HTML documents are rendered by the browser to display information.

**JavaScript:**

1. **Purpose:** JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to manipulate the DOM, handle user events, make asynchronous requests, and perform various other actions on the client side.

2. **Example:**
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Interactive Page</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       <h1 id="greeting">Hello, World!</h1>
       <button onclick="changeGreeting()">Change Greeting</button>

       <script>
           function changeGreeting() {
               document.getElementById("greeting").innerHTML = "New Greeting!";
           }
       </script>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. **Use Cases:** JavaScript is used for creating dynamic content, handling user interactions, validating forms, making asynchronous requests to servers (AJAX), and updating the DOM in response to events. It enhances the user experience by providing a more interactive and responsive interface.

**When to Use Each:**

- **Use HTML when:**
  - Defining the structure and content of a webpage.
  - Creating static elements like text, images, and links.
  - Setting up the basic layout of the page.

- **Use JavaScript when:**
  - Adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to a webpage.
  - Handling user input and events, such as button clicks.
  - Making asynchronous requests to servers for data.
  - Manipulating the DOM to update content dynamically.

In practice, HTML and JavaScript work together to create a complete and interactive web experience. HTML defines the structure and content, while JavaScript adds the necessary functionality to make the webpage dynamic and responsive.
