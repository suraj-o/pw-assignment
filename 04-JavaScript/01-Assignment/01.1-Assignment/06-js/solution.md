Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names in JavaScript is crucial for writing code that is readable, maintainable, and easily understandable. Clear identifiers make it easier for developers (including yourself) to comprehend the purpose and usage of variables, functions, and other elements in the code. Here are some reasons why meaningful variable names are important:

1. **Readability:** Descriptive names contribute to the overall readability of your code. When someone reads your code, they can quickly grasp the purpose and role of a variable without needing to delve into the details of its implementation.

2. **Maintenance:** Meaningful names make it easier to maintain and update your code. When you or others revisit the codebase, having clear identifiers reduces the likelihood of introducing errors while making modifications.

3. **Understanding:** Well-chosen variable names improve the understanding of the code. This is especially important when sharing code with team members or working on collaborative projects.

4. **Documentation:** Descriptive names can serve as a form of documentation. They convey the developer's intentions and help explain the logic and functionality of the code.

5. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Clear identifiers reduce cognitive load by providing immediate insights into the purpose of variables. Developers spend less time deciphering the code, leading to increased productivity.

**Example:**

Consider the following example where meaningful variable names enhance code readability:

```javascript
// Not-so-descriptive variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let z = x + y;

// More descriptive variable names
let firstNumber = 10;
let secondNumber = 5;

let sum = firstNumber + secondNumber;
```

In this example, the second set of variables (`firstNumber`, `secondNumber`, and `sum`) have more descriptive names. When someone reads the code, it becomes immediately clear that these variables represent numbers and that `sum` holds the result of adding `firstNumber` and `secondNumber`. This clarity makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

Choosing meaningful variable names is a simple yet powerful practice that significantly contributes to the overall quality of your code. It enhances collaboration, reduces bugs, and ensures that your code remains maintainable over time.
