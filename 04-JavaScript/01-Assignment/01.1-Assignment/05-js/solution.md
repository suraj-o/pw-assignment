Comments in JavaScript serve as annotations within the code to explain its logic, provide documentation, or temporarily disable specific sections. They are essential for improving code readability, facilitating collaboration among developers, and documenting the purpose and functionality of various code segments. Comments are ignored by the JavaScript interpreter and have no impact on the program's execution.

Here are examples of single-line and multi-line comments in JavaScript:

**Single-Line Comments:**

Single-line comments are used to annotate a single line of code.

```javascript
// This is a single-line comment
let x = 5; // Variable x is assigned the value 5
```

In the example above, the comment after the code explains the purpose of the variable assignment.

**Multi-Line Comments:**

Multi-line comments are used to annotate multiple lines of code or create more extensive documentation.

```javascript
/*
  This is a multi-line comment.
  It can span multiple lines and is useful for providing
  detailed explanations or commenting out blocks of code.

  let y = 10;
  console.log(y);
*/
```

In this example, the multi-line comment provides a more detailed explanation and includes commented-out code that won't be executed.

**Importance of Comments:**

1. **Code Explanation:** Comments clarify the purpose of code, making it easier for developers (including yourself) to understand the logic and functionality.

2. **Documentation:** Comments can serve as documentation, explaining how to use functions or providing context for specific code sections.

3. **Troubleshooting:** Comments can help troubleshoot and debug code by providing insights into the developer's intentions or by temporarily disabling problematic sections for testing.

4. **Collaboration:** When working in a team, comments enhance collaboration by allowing team members to understand each other's code and make modifications more confidently.

5. **Code Maintenance:** Comments assist in maintaining and updating code. When revisiting code after a period, comments can quickly refresh your memory about the purpose and functionality of different sections.

While comments are valuable, it's essential to strike a balance. Over-commenting can clutter the code, and well-written, self-explanatory code often requires fewer comments. Use comments judiciously, focusing on explaining complex or non-intuitive sections of your code.
