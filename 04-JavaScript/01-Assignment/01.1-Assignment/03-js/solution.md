In JavaScript, primitive data types are the most basic types of data, and they are immutable (cannot be changed). There are five primitive data types:

1. **String:**
   - **Description:** Strings represent sequences of characters and are used to store and manipulate text.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let greeting = "Hello, World!";
     ```

2. **Number:**
   - **Description:** Numbers represent numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let age = 25;
     let price = 12.99;
     ```

3. **Boolean:**
   - **Description:** Booleans represent logical values: `true` or `false`. They are often used in conditional statements and comparisons.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let isStudent = true;
     let hasLicense = false;
     ```

4. **Undefined:**
   - **Description:** The `undefined` type has only one value, which is `undefined`. It is used to denote the absence of a value or an uninitialized variable.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let undefinedVariable;
     ```

5. **Null:**
   - **Description:** The `null` type also has only one value, which is `null`. It is often used to explicitly represent the absence of any object value or as a placeholder.
   - **Example:**
     ```javascript
     let user = null;
     ```

These primitive data types are the foundation for all other data types in JavaScript. Objects and functions, for example, are not primitive types but are built upon these basic types. Understanding and working with primitive data types is fundamental to programming in JavaScript.
