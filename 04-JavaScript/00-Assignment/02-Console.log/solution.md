### Problem: Why console (log, alert, prompt) is not part of official Ecmascript docs: [Link](https://262.ecma-international.org/10.0/#sec-intro)

### Solution:

`Because it is not the native code of JavaScript language it is the object define inside the runtime environment ( browser runtime environment, node runtime environment, etc) basically used for debugging the code, and the value return by the console object is undefined.`
